    <section id="Intro">
        <p>I am a passionate coder. I’m always eager to learn new things. Exploring technology has been one of my greatest passions. Every day, I try to pick up something new, whether big or small. Coding challenges excite me and drive me to grow as a developer. Alongside coding, I love discovering new hobbies and interests. Trying new activities helps me stay creative and balanced in life. I believe learning doesn’t stop at one skill; it’s a lifelong journey. That’s why I keep experimenting and pushing myself out of my comfort zone. This blog is a small space where I can share my journey with you. It’s not just about coding, but about everything that inspires me. From hobbies to daily thoughts, I’ll document it all here. I hope this page provides a glimpse into my world of curiosity. And maybe, it can inspire you to explore and create too!
