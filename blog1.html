        <h1>The Battle With Attendance</h1>

        <p>Managing attendance feels like one of the toughest battles in college life. At the start of every semester, I make promises to myself—no bunking, no skipping classes, and definitely not relying on proxies. The energy is high, and the goals are crystal clear. I even color-code my timetable and set alarms with motivational names like “Rise and Grind” and “Don’t Ruin Your Future.” For the first week, I’m unstoppable.</p>
        <p>But slowly, reality hits. A late-night assignment, a surprise test in another subject, or just the temptation of sleeping in makes those “just one” missed classes pile up. Before I know it, I’m sitting with a calculator, figuring out how many more classes I can bunk without slipping under 75%. Honestly, at this point, attendance isn’t just about marks—it’s about survival strategies. 😅</p>
        <p>There’s a whole underground economy of attendance hacks. Friends form proxy alliances, group chats buzz with “Who’s going today?” and some students even master the art of walking in just as the professor takes roll. I’ve seen people sprint across campus like it’s the Olympics just to make it in time for that sacred “present.” And then there’s the heartbreak of realizing the professor took attendance five minutes early. Brutal.</p>
        <p>The worst is when you genuinely show up, sit through the entire lecture, and later find out your name wasn’t marked. That’s when you start questioning everything—your existence, your visibility, and whether you should’ve just stayed in bed. Some professors are chill, others guard the attendance sheet like it’s the crown jewels. You learn to navigate personalities as much as you do subjects.</p>
        <p>In the end, managing attendance becomes a game of strategy, stamina, and sheer luck. It teaches you more about time management, negotiation, and crisis control than any textbook ever could. And while I may not always win the battle, I’ve definitely earned my stripes in the war. Here’s to the 75% warriors—may your alarms be loud, your proxies loyal, and your professors merciful.</p>
